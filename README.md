# Run 1802

## [Run on-line](https://bobkuczewski.github.io/RCA1802SimJS/)

This project contains a Javascript simulation of an RCA 1802 microprocessor.
The easiest way to run it is to press each of the buttons along the top from
left to right up to and including the "Run/Stop" button. This will do the following:

    Set the power-on state
    Zero all the registers
    Zero all of the memory
    Load the program from hex code
    Reset the 1802 processor
    Start running the program

Not all of those steps are strictly needed, but clicking all of them ensures
a somewhat repeatable experience.

Some help is available in the "Documentation and Examples" section at the bottom.
The drop-down selector shows the available pages. After making a selection, the
"Load" button can be used to show that page.
